# 🤖 MUVERA PassageIQ AI — Smarter Passage-Level SEO Analyzer

**MUVERA PassageIQ AI** is a micro-tool for smarter SEO — built to help writers and content marketers check **retrievability** and **search intent alignment** passage by passage.

Good SEO content isn’t just about stuffing keywords — it’s about actually answering what people search for.  
This tool shows you which parts of your draft are strong, which are weak, and where you can align better with real search intent.

## 🧩 What’s MUVERA?

**MUVERA** stands for **Multi-Vector Retrieval Analyzer** — inspired by multi-vector retrieval techniques used in semantic search and modern RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipelines.

**The idea:** bring **retrievability** and **intent alignment** front and center for writers and SEOs.  
Every chunk of text should be **findable**, **relevant**, and **valuable** — for Google *and* for real people.

## 🔍 How It Works

✅ Breaks your draft into **bite-sized passages** (~50–150 words each)  
✅ Uses **sentence-transformers** (MiniLM) for lightweight semantic similarity  
✅ Computes a **Retrievability Score** (0.0–1.0) for each passage vs. your query  
✅ Highlights **Top Passages** to reuse for snippets, intros, or meta descriptions  
✅ Flags **Weak Passages** so you can rewrite them to better match intent  
✅ Generates a **chart + CSV export** — because who doesn’t love actionable data?

## ⚙️ How It’s Built

- 🧠 Uses **sentence embeddings** for semantic scoring
- 🔍 Applies **cosine similarity** to mimic multi-vector retrieval (like a mini in-house RAG!)
- ⚡ Built with **Streamlit** for a fast, user-friendly UI — paste your draft, add a query, analyze!

## 💡 Why I Built It

1. I got tired of guessing which parts of my content actually answer the user’s query.
2. Tools exist for keyword stuffing — but what about **retrievability**?
3. This is my small step towards writing for **humans + search engines**, not one or the other.
